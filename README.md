Hi.
# Script_cmd_web.v2
is a project that I am currently working on for educational purposes.

Its purpose is to explain how languages are structured, while learning them. e.g.
# HTML5 ; Java Script ; CSS3 ; C# ; C++ ; Python;

PS. Yes, this is the second version. 

Believe me, you wouldn't want to see the first one.
